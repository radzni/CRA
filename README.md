had to invite my friend to the repository to push it here cause for some reason he is registered as the owner of the virtual enviroment why i open it in vscode (he use to borrow my laptop for coding).
After i cloned my repository in a folder i proceeded to make the virtual invironment inside then activate it so everything i install stay inside the venv after that i install flask_MySQLdb as to the video instructed
then i proceeded to develop the CRUD-REST-API i forgot to record the first stages of development so i just repeated it that is why the first 3 to 4 commits may be closer in time than the last 2
Di ko po marecord yung mga commits kung di ko upload yung boung environment
if need to download only download app.py, template folder, and static place them in an invironmetn on own PC and pip install Flask_MySQLdb
