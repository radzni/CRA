had to invite my friend to the repository to push it here cause for some reason he is registered as the owner of the virtual enviroment why i open it in vscode (he use to borrow my laptop for coding).
After i cloned my repository in a folder i proceeded to make the virtual invironment inside then activate it so everything i install stay inside the venv after that i install flask_MySQLdb as to the video instructed
then i proceeded to develop the CRUD-REST-API i forgot to record the first stages of development so i just repeated it that is why the first 3 to 4 commits may be closer in time than the last 2
